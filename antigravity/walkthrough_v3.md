# Project Walkthrough (v3): Scenario 11 Dry Run

## Context
This document tracks the project status following the successful implementation of 5 core refinements (R1, R1.1, R2, R3, R4) and the successful dry run of Scenario 10.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For historical context and detailed verification of individual refinements and Scenario 10, see [walkthrough_v2.md](file:///home/chaschel/Documents/ibm/ai/PocketFlow-Template-Python-main/antigravity/walkthrough_v2.md).

## Current Objective: Scenario 11 (Gate Code Update)

The goal of this run is to verify the agent's ability to handle updates to existing bookings (gate code) while maintaining identity consistency and professional response quality.
