# Project Walkthrough (v6): Scenario 14 Dry Run

## Context
This document tracks the project status following the successful implementation of 5 core refinements and successful dry runs of Scenarios 10, 11, 12, and 13 (Qualitative).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For historical context and detailed verification of individual refinements and previous scenarios, see [walkthrough_v5.md](file:///home/chaschel/Documents/ibm/ai/PocketFlow-Template-Python-main/antigravity/walkthrough_v5.md).

## Current Objective: Scenario 14 (Strange Noise/Attic Unit)

The goal of this run is to verify the agent's ability to handle technical descriptions (thumping sound) and specific location details (attic unit) while maintaining the booking flow and verifying R1's persistence.
