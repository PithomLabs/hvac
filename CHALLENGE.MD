Prompt Engineering Challenge: HVAC Service Booking Agent

Objective
Design and refine a prompt for an AI-powered conversational agent that assists customers in booking HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) services. The agent should guide users through a structured booking process, ensuring all necessary information is collected and service requirements are met.

Tasks
Initial Agent Implementation
Implement an agent CLI in python using an LLM wrapper of your choice—eg. https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/.

Sample Conversation Generation
Create a set of realistic conversation scenarios (at least 10) that cover various customer needs, questions, and potential issues related to booking an HVAC service. Aim for diversity in problem types (e.g., AC repair, furnace maintenance, installation), property types, location, and customer interactions.

Prompt Crafting and Documentation
Develop an initial prompt for the agent that instructs it on how to guide the booking process.
Document your prompt design strategy. Explain the reasoning behind your prompt's structure, instructions, and any specific techniques used.

Agent Execution and Analysis
Run the generated sample conversations through the agent using your initial prompt.
Record and analyze the agent's output. Identify areas where the agent performs well and areas that need improvement.

Prompt Refinement and Iteration
Refine your prompt based on the analysis of the initial run.
Document the changes you made and explain the rationale behind them.
Repeat the execution and analysis process with the refined prompt.
Continue iterating until the agent demonstrates a significant improvement in its ability to handle the booking process effectively.
Visually represent the prompt refinement process (e.g., using diagrams, flowcharts) to illustrate the evolution of your approach.
