|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **1. Service Accuracy** | Pass | 5/5 | Correctly mapped "AC stopped making noise" to "Repair". |

| **3. Customer Experience** | Pass | 5/5 | High empathy regarding the baby and the heat wave. Professional tone. |
| **4. End-Stage Spiel Only** | Pass | 5/5 | "Anything else" appeared only after HB-XXXX was confirmed. |
| **5. Great Day Closing** | Pass | 5/5 | Explicitly used "Have a great day" in the closing handshake. |

## 2. Narrative Analysis

### Key Successes
- **Urgency Awareness**: The agent immediately acknowledged the 95-degree heat and the safety of the baby, building instant rapport with Sarah Jenkins.
- **Decision Continuity**: The `DecideNode` successfully navigated the transition from "Missing Data" (chat/extract) to "Ready to Book" (book) without stuttering or looping.
- **Post-Booking Resilience**: When Sarah asked a follow-up question about technician experience after the booking, the agent stayed in Phase 2, addressed the concern empathetically, and reiterated the confirmation details.

### Identified Improvements
- **Constraint Parsing**: While the agent captured "San Jose, CA", the simulator used "Jacksonville" in the response body. This is a simulator/scenario alignment issue rather than an agent failure, but highlights the need for strict data-schema adherence in test environments.

## 3. Deployment Recommendation
The agent logic for high-urgency repair scenarios is **STABLE**. No further prompt refinements are required for Scenario 1.
