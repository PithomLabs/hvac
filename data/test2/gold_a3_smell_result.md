## 2. Narrative Analysis

### Key Successes
- **Objection Handling**: The agent handled Kevin Durant's concerns about technician experience and pricing with specific, reassuring details, successfully converting a skeptical customer.
- **Urgency Framing**: Acknowledged the smell immediately and framed the 6 PM slot as an "emergency" priority, aligning with the safety nature of the request.
- **Phase Transition**: Successfully managed a long Phase 1 (Solutioning) that involved pricing and experience questions before executing a clean Phase 2 (Handshake).

### Identified Improvements
- **Safety Directive**: While the agent acknowledged the concern, it could be even more explicit about immediate safety actions (e.g., "Please turn off the furnace immediately") similar to the advice given in the Leaking Furnace scenario.
- **Extraction vs Chat Balance**: The agent spent several turns in `chat` before `book`. While this was necessary for objection handling, the transition to `book` was decisive once the user said "Sure, I’ll confirm".

## 3. Deployment Recommendation
The agent logic for high-tension and skeptical customer scenarios is **STABLE**. The ability to pivot between technical advice and conversion (ABC) is a significant strength.
