**As a stressed customer, here are my initial replies to each scenario:**

---

### **A: EMERGENCY**

**1. AC Dead**
"Hi there, it's 95 degrees and my AC just stopped making noise. I have a baby in the house and it's getting really hot. Can you help?"

**2. Leaking Furnace**
"There is water pooling around the bottom of my furnace in the basement. It looks like it's leaking!"

**3. Burning Smell**
"I just turned on the heat for the first time this season and it smells like burning plastic. What should I do?"

**4. Frozen Coil**
"Help! My AC is barely blowing any air and I see actual ice on the copper pipe outside near the unit."

---

### **B: MAINTENANCE**

**5. Annual Tune-Up**
"I just want to schedule my spring cleaning for the AC."

**6. Filter Confusion**
"My thermostat says 'change filter' but I don't know which size I need. Can you tell me?"

**7. Smart Thermostat**
"I just bought a Nest thermostat. Can you guys install it for me?"

**8. System Replacement**
"Our AC is 20 years old and keeps breaking down. We want a quote for a new system."

### **C: LOGISTICS**

**9. Reschedule**
"I have a booking for tomorrow, but I need to move it to next week."

**10. Specific Window**
"I need a technician to come out, but it has to be Tuesday between 2 PM and 4 PM."

**11. Gate Code**
"I'm booking a service, but the technician needs the gate code: 1234."

**12. Tenant/Landlord**
"I'm a tenant at 555 Pine St. The AC is broken, but my landlord, Mr. Smith, will be paying for the repair."

---

### **D: EDGE CASES**

**13. Price Haggle**
"$150 for a diagnostic visit? Joe's HVAC down the street does it for $75. Why are you so expensive?"

**14. Vague Noise**
"My AC is making a weird 'thump' sound at night. It's really annoying."

**15. Wrong Area**
"I noticed your ad. Can you come out to my place in Springfield? It's about 50 miles away."

**16. Callback/Angry**
"You guys were here yesterday and it's broken again! I paid $300 and my house is still freezing! This is unacceptable!"

---

### **E: TECHNICAL**

**17. Heat Pump**
"My heat is out, but I don't know if I have a furnace or a heat pump. Does it matter?"

**18. Duct Cleaning**
"I've been sneezing a lot since we started using the AC. Do you guys do duct cleaning?"

**19. Simplified/Language**
"Heat no work. Cold house. Help."

**20. Nonsense Input**
