## 1. Scorecard: Heuristic Ranking

| Metric | Status | Rank | Analysis |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **1. Service Accuracy** | Pass | 5/5 | Correctly identified "ice on pipes" as a Frozen Coil issue requiring Repair. |
| **2. Always Be Closing (ABC)** | Fail | 2/5 | Failed to secure a confirmed booking within the 11-turn limit due to excessive technical dialogue. |
| **3. Customer Experience** | Pass | 4/5 | Provided excellent safety advice (thawing instructions) but was overly verbose. |
| **4. End-Stage Spiel Only** | N/A | - | Conversation dropped before reaching the closing stage. |
| **5. Great Day Closing** | Fail | 0/5 | Simulation terminated due to turn limit; no handshake reached. |

**Final Status**: ❌ **DROPPED / NO CLOSURE**
**Efficiency**: 11 Turns (Limit Reached)

## 2. Narrative Analysis

### Root Cause of Failure
The agent correctly identified the Frozen Coil but became trapped in a **Technical Support Loop**. 
- It provided detailed advice on turning off the unit, checking filters, and waiting 24 hours.
- While this advice is business-correct, the agent failed to pivot back to **ABC (Always Be Closing)** quickly enough to finalize the booking before the simulation's safety dropout (11 turns).
- The newly implemented **1s Pacing Delay** and **3-turn Extraction Guardrail** may have contributed to a slower overall cadence, pushing the conversation beyond the limit.

### Key Successes (Logic)
- Acknowledged the emergency nature of a frozen coil.
- Correctly instructed the user to turn off the AC to prevent compressor damage (Safety Priority).

### Identified Improvements
- **Pivot Logic**: The agent needs a stronger directive to transition from "Advice" to "Booking" in fewer turns.
- **Verbose Responses**: Responses were too long, leading to turn-overhead. We should refine the `ChatNode` to be more concise in diagnostic scenarios.

## 3. Remediation Recommendation
- **Status**: **FAILED**. Requires Refinement.
- **Action**: Update `chat_system.txt` to prioritize "Advice + Booking Request" as a single combined unit rather than separate turns. We need to reduce the "turn-friction" for technical scenarios.
