## 1. Scorecard: Heuristic Ranking

| Metric | Status | Rank | Analysis |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **1. Service Accuracy** | Pass | 5/5 | Correctly identified "water pooling under the furnace" as a Repair issue. |
| **2. Always Be Closing (ABC)** | Pass | 5/5 | Initiated booking immediately upon gathering name, address, and issue. |
| **3. Customer Experience** | Pass | 5/5 | Provided urgent advice (turn off the furnace) and maintained a helpful tone. |
| **4. End-Stage Spiel Only** | Pass | 5/5 | Closing spiel was correctly reserved for post-booking confirmation. |
| **5. Great Day Closing** | Pass | 5/5 | Ended with a polite "Have a great day" handshake. |

**Final Status**: ✅ **PASS**
**Efficiency**: 5 Turns (Highly Efficient)

## 2. Narrative Analysis

### Key Successes
- **Safety First**: The agent correctly prioritized the user's property safety by advising to turn off the furnace and mop up the water before proceeding with the booking.
- **Minimalist Data Gathering**: The agent efficiently extracted the location and name in a single turn after the user provided them, avoiding redundant questions.
- **Technical Competency**: Acknowledged the potential danger of water near electrical components, reinforcing the "Lead Technician" brand voice.

### Identified Improvements
- **Extraction Attempt Handling**: The internal logs showed several `DecideNode` calls to `extract` before settling on `chat`. While it didn't affect the user experience, further refinement could streamline the decision logic for faster response times.

## 3. Deployment Recommendation
The agent logic for leaking system scenarios is **STABLE**. The "Safety Escape" protocols implemented in previous refinements are functioning as intended.
