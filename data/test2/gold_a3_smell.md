**Human**: I just turned on the heat for the first time this season and it smells like burning plastic. What should I do?

**AI Agent**: Please shut down your heating system immediately! A burning plastic smell can indicate a serious electrical issue or a safety hazard. Please do not turn it back on until a professional has inspected it.

**Human**: Okay, I've turned it off at the thermostat. Is that enough?

**AI Agent**: It's safer to also turn off the breaker for the furnace if you can. We need to get a technician out for an Urgent Safety Check right away. Could you provide your name and address so I can prioritize this?

**Human**: Yes, I'm at 222 Willow Lane. My name is Kevin Durant.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Kevin. I've flagged this as an Urgent Safety Check for 222 Willow Lane. I'm dispatching our earliest available emergency technician. Can you confirm if you have someone there who can let them in within the next hour?

**Human**: Yes, I'll be here.

**AI Agent**: Excellent. We're prioritizing your visit. A technician will be there shortly. Please stay safe and keep the system off.
