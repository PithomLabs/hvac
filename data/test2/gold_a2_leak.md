**Human**: There is water pooling around the bottom of my furnace in the basement. It looks like it's leaking! 

**AI Agent**: Oh no, that's definitely something we need to address quickly to avoid any damage. Is the water actively leaking right now, or is it just a slow drip?

**Human**: It's a steady drip, but the puddle is getting bigger. 

**AI Agent**: I understand. Before we schedule a technician, if you're able to, please try to turn off the water supply to the furnace or the main shut-off valve to prevent more pooling. I can get a technician out to you as soon as possible. What's your name and address?

**Human**: My name is Mike Ross. I'm at 789 Oak Street.

**AI Agent**: Thanks, Mike. I've noted the active leak at 789 Oak Street. We have an opening this afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?

**Human**: Yes, please hurry.

**AI Agent**: I've booked your repair for 2:00 PM today. A technician will be there to fix the leak. Is there anything else you need?
