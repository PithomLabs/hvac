# Test Conversation 05: Strange Smell

**Human**: There's a weird burning smell coming from the vents when the heater kicks on.

**AI Agent**: That is definitely something we want to check out right away for your safety. It could just be dust, but it's always better to be safe. May I have your name and address to get a technician scheduled?

**Human**: Eve Wilson, 123 Elm Ct.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Eve. I have you down at 123 Elm Ct. Safety is our top priority, so I've found an opening this afternoon at 3:00 PM. Does that work for you?

**Human**: Yes, 3:00 PM is fine.

**AI Agent**: Excellent. We'll have a technician at your home by 3:00 PM today to investigate that smell. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you notice anything else.

**Human**: Okay, thanks.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome, Eve. Stay safe!
