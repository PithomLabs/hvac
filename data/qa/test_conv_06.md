# Test Conversation 06: Noisy Furnace

**Human**: My furnace is making a loud banging noise every time it starts up. It's waking up the baby!

**AI Agent**: Oh, I am so sorry! A noisy furnace is stressful enough, but waking up a sleeping baby makes it a real emergency. We want to get that settled for you as quickly as possible. Could you please share your name and address?

**Human**: Frank Castle, 444 Birch St.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Frank. We'll do our best to get that noise silenced at 444 Birch St. We have a technician in your area who can stop by tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. Would that be helpful?

**Human**: Yes, the earlier the better. 8 AM is great.

**AI Agent**: Perfect. We've got you confirmed for 8:00 AM tomorrow. We'll get that banging fixed so everyone can get some rest. Is there anything else I can do for you?

**Human**: No, that's all.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome. Best of luck with the little one, Frank!
