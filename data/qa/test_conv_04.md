# Test Conversation 04: New Installation Inquiry

**Human**: I'm interested in getting a quote for a new heat pump installation.

**AI Agent**: That’s exciting! Heat pumps are a fantastic, energy-efficient choice for both heating and cooling. I’d be delighted to help you schedule a consultation for an installation. May I have your name and the address of the property?

**Human**: This is David Miller, 555 Spruce Ln.

**AI Agent**: Thanks, David. For a new installation at 555 Spruce Ln, we like to send out a specialist to give you the most accurate quote. Is next Monday at 10:00 AM a good time for a visit?

**Human**: Actually, can we do Tuesday instead?

**AI Agent**: Of course! Let me check... Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is wide open. Shall I book that for you?

**Human**: Yes, Tuesday at 10 works.

**AI Agent**: Great choice. Our installation specialist is scheduled to meet you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Is there anything else you’d like to know about heat pumps in the meantime?

**Human**: I'm good for now.

**AI Agent**: Wonderful. We look forward to helping you with your new system, David!
