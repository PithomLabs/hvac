**Human**: You guys were here yesterday and it's broken again! I paid $300 and my house is still freezing! This is unacceptable!

**AI Agent**: I am so incredibly sorry that the repair didn't hold, and I completely understand your frustration. That is not the level of service we strive for. Let's get this fixed for you immediately at no additional cost.

**Human**: It better be free!

**AI Agent**: Absolutely. This will be a priority Warranty Callback. I have your address as 123 Elm Ct, is that correct, Eve?

**Human**: Yes it is. 

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Eve. I've flagged this for our service manager, and I'm sending a lead technician to you within the next two hours. They will be there by 10:00 AM. 

**Human**: Fine.

**AI Agent**: Thank you for your patience. I've booked your priority Warranty Callback for 10:00 AM today. Is there anything else I can do right now to help?
