**Human**: My AC is making a weird 'thump' sound at night. It's really annoying.

**AI Agent**: That sounds frustrating! To help our technician diagnose this better, could you tell me where the sound seems to be coming from—the indoor unit or the outside one? And does it happen only when the system starts up or while it's running?

**Human**: It's the unit in the attic. It happens every time it kicks on.

**AI Agent**: Thank you for those details! That 'thumping' on startup often points to a blower motor or ductwork issue. We should have a technician take a look. Could you provide your name and address?

**Human**: I'm Art Vandelay. 129 West 81st St. 

**AI Agent**: Got it, Art. I've noted the attic unit thumping on startup. We can have someone out tomorrow at 1:00 PM. Does that work?

**Human**: Yes, that's fine.

**AI Agent**: You're all set, Art. I've booked your Diagnostic visit for tomorrow at 1:00 PM. Our tech will investigate that thump in the attic. Is there anything else?
