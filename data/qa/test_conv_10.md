# Test Conversation 10: Small Office Inquiry

**Human**: Our small office unit seems to be freezing up. The vents are barely blowing.

**AI Agent**: That sounds like a classic freezing issue, which can definitely disrupt the workday! I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I'd be happy to get a commercial technician out to your office. Could I have your name and the office address?

**Human**: Jack Sparrow, 666 Harbor Way, Suite 200.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Jack. We'll get the air flowing again at Harbor Way. We have an expert available tomorrow at 2:00 PM. How does that sound?

**Human**: 2:00 PM tomorrow works for us.

**AI Agent**: Perfect. I've confirmed your office service for tomorrow at 2:00 PM. We'll have you back to a comfortable working temperature soon. Is there anything else I can help with today?

**Human**: No, that's great.

**AI Agent**: Wonderful. Have a productive afternoon, Jack!
