**Human**: My heat is out, but I don't know if I have a furnace or a heat pump. Does it matter?

**AI Agent**: It does matter for making sure we send the right technician with the right parts! A quick way to tell: do you have a large unit outside that runs even when you're heating the house, or is it just a furnace inside?

**Human**: I have a big black fan unit outside that's blowing cold air right now.

**AI Agent**: That sounds like a heat pump! Since it's blowing cold air outside while trying to heat, it might be a defrost issue or a reversing valve problem. I'll make sure to send a heat pump specialist. Can I get your name and address?

**Human**: I'm Cosmo Kramer. 129 West 81st St. 

**AI Agent**: Thanks, Cosmo. I've noted that you have a heat pump. We have an opening today at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?

**Human**: Yes, that works.

**AI Agent**: Excellent. I've booked your Heat Pump Repair for 2:00 PM today at 129 West 81st St. Our tech will be there soon. Anything else?
