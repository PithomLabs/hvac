# Test Conversation 09: Rental Property Repair

**Human**: I'm a landlord and my tenant at 777 Lucky Ln says the AC isn't cooling properly.

**AI Agent**: I understand. Managing repairs for tenants can be a lot to handle, and we want to make sure they're comfortable. I'd be happy to help you get that AC repaired. Could I please have your name and a contact number?

**Human**: I'm Ivy Chen, and you can reach me at 555-8888.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Ivy. I've got the request for 777 Lucky Ln. We have a slot available this Friday at 10:00 AM. Would you like me to coordinate with you or the tenant?

**Human**: Friday at 10 is fine. You can talk to the tenant for access, but bill me.

**AI Agent**: Understood, Ivy. I've booked the repair for Friday at 10:00 AM at 777 Lucky Ln. We'll coordinate access and ensure the billing goes to you as requested. Anything else?

**Human**: That covers it. Thanks.

**AI Agent**: You're welcome, Ivy. We'll get it taken care of!
