**Human**: I need a technician to check my AC, but I can only be home between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM on Thursdays. Do you have anything then?

**AI Agent**: I understand. Having a specific window is helpful for planning. Let me check our schedule for Thursdays between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM. 

**Human**: Thanks. It's for 555 Spruce Lane. My name is David Miller.

**AI Agent**: I've found an opening next Thursday at 1:00 PM, which fits perfectly within your window. Would you like to book that?

**Human**: Yes, that works.

**AI Agent**: You're all set, David. I've booked your AC check for next Thursday at 1:00 PM at 555 Spruce Lane. Is there anything else I can help you with?
