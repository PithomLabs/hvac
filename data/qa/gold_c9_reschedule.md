**Human**: I have a tech coming Tuesday, but I have to work. Can we do Friday instead? My name is Jerry Seinfeld.

**AI Agent**: Hi Jerry! I can certainly help you reschedule that. Let me look up your appointment for 129 West 81st St. I see you're scheduled for Tuesday. Let me check our availability for Friday.

**Human**: Friday afternoon would be best.

**AI Agent**: We have an opening this Friday at 3:00 PM. Would that work for your schedule?

**Human**: Yes, that's perfect. Thanks for the quick change.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome, Jerry. I've successfully rescheduled your appointment to Friday at 3:00 PM. We've sent a confirmation to your phone. Is there anything else you need?
