**Human**: I noticed your ad. Can you come out to my place in Springfield? It's about 50 miles away. 

**AI Agent**: I'd love to help you, but Springfield is actually just outside our current service area. We typically stay within a 30-mile radius of our main office to ensure we can provide timely service and keep our travel fees reasonable for customers.

**Human**: Oh, that's too bad. Do you know anyone else?

**AI Agent**: While I can't officially vouch for them, I've heard good things about Springfield Heating & Cooling. They might be a great option for you in that area!

**Human**: Thanks for the tip.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome! If you ever have property closer to our area, we'd be honored to assist you. Have a wonderful day!
