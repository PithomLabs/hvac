**Human**: I am the tenant at 777 Lucky Ln, but my landlord pays for repairs. The AC isn't cooling properly. Can you bill him?

**AI Agent**: I understand. We can certainly set up billing for your landlord, but we do need their authorization and contact information before we can proceed with a billed service. Do you have your landlord's name and phone number?

**Human**: Yes, his name is Mr. Potter and his number is 555-0199. My name is Ivy Chen.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Ivy. I've noted Mr. Potter's information for the billing at 777 Lucky Ln. I'll reach out to him to confirm the billing details. In the meantime, would you like to schedule the repair visit? We have a slot tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

**Human**: Yes, tomorrow at 1:00 PM works.

**AI Agent**: Perfect. I've booked your AC Repair for tomorrow at 1:00 PM at 777 Lucky Ln. I'll coordinate the payment with Mr. Potter. Is there anything else you need?
