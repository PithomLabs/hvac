**Human**: $150 for a diagnostic visit? Joe's HVAC down the street does it for $75. Why are you so expensive?

**AI Agent**: I understand that price is an important factor. While Joe's may have a lower initial fee, our $150 covers a comprehensive diagnostic by a fully licensed, bonded, and insured technician. We also provide a 1-year warranty on any repairs we perform and use only factory-certified parts. Your safety and the long-term health of your system are our top priorities.

**Human**: I guess that makes sense. I don't want a hack job.

**AI Agent**: We'd be happy to show you the difference quality service makes. Should we go ahead and get that diagnostic scheduled for you?

**Human**: Fine. My name is George Costanza. I'm at 101 Vandelay Way. 

**AI Agent**: Thank you, George. I appreciate your trust in us. We have an opening today at 4:30 PM. Does that work?

**Human**: Yes.

**AI Agent**: Great. I've booked your AC Diagnostic for 4:30 PM today at 101 Vandelay Way. Our tech will see you then. Anything else?
