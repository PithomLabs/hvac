# Test Conversation 08: Duct Cleaning

**Human**: Do you guys do duct cleaning? My allergies are acting up.

**AI Agent**: We certainly do! I'm sorry to hear your allergies are bothering you—duct cleaning can often make a big difference in air quality. I’d love to help you schedule that. May I have your name and address, please?

**Human**: Hank Hill, 84 Rainey St.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Hank. Improving the air quality at 84 Rainey St sounds like a great plan. We have a duct cleaning special running this Wednesday at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?

**Human**: Wednesday at 9 sounds good, I tell you what.

**AI Agent**: Excellent! I've booked your duct cleaning for Wednesday at 9:00 AM. Hopefully, that brings some relief for your allergies. Is there anything else I can assist with?
