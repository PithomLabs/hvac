# Test Conversation 03: Urgent Leak

**Human**: Help! There is water leaking from my indoor AC unit and it's getting on the carpet!

**AI Agent**: Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear about the leak—that certainly sounds urgent. Please, if you can, turn off the system to prevent any further water damage. Could you provide your name and address so I can see how quickly we can get someone out there?

**Human**: It's Charlie Brown, 321 Pine Rd. Please hurry!

**AI Agent**: I understand completely, Charlie. I've prioritized your request for 321 Pine Rd. We have an emergency slot available in two hours, at 11:00 AM today. Can we put you down for that?

**Human**: Yes, please!

**AI Agent**: You're all set for 11:00 AM today. Our technician will be there shortly to address the leak. Hang in there!

**Human**: Thank you so much.

**AI Agent**: You are very welcome. We'll see you soon.
