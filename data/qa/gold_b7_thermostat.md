**Human**: I bought a Nest thermostat. Can you guys install it? How much?

**AI Agent**: We sure can! Our standard rate for a thermostat installation is $129. Before we schedule that, do you know if your current system has a 'C-wire' or common wire connected? It's usually needed for a Nest.

**Human**: I'm not sure, but the box said it might need one. I have $129, that works.

**AI Agent**: Great! If a C-wire is missing, our technician can install a Power Connector for an additional $49 if needed. Would you like to schedule that installation? I'll need your name and address.

**Human**: Yes, I'm Cosmo Kramer, 129 West 81st St.

**AI Agent**: Perfect, Cosmo. We have a technician in your area tomorrow afternoon. Does 2:00 PM work for you?

**Human**: Yeah, that's fine.

**AI Agent**: You're all set! I've booked your Nest Thermostat Installation for tomorrow at 2:00 PM at 129 West 81st St. Is there anything else?
