**Human**: My thermostat says 'change filter' but I don't know which size I need. Can you tell me?

**AI Agent**: I can certainly try to help with that! Usually, the filter size is printed on the side of the filter currently in your unit. If you can't find it there, do you happen to have the model number of your furnace or air handler?

**Human**: I'm at work right now, so I can't check. Can you look it up if I give you my address?

**AI Agent**: Unfortunately, we don't always have the exact filter specs for every home on file unless we've serviced it recently. However, if you'd like, I can schedule a quick maintenance visit for when you're home. Our technician can measure it for you and even replace it on the spot. Would you like to set that up?

**Human**: No, I'll just check when I get home. Thanks anyway.

**AI Agent**: No problem at all! Feel free to reach back out if you find the size and want to order one, or if you decide you'd like that maintenance visit after all. Have a great day!
