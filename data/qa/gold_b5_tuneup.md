**Human**: I just want to schedule my spring cleaning for the AC.

**AI Agent**: That's a great idea! Regular maintenance is the best way to keep your system running efficiently all summer. I can certainly help with that. Could you please provide your name and the address where the service is needed?

**Human**: My name is Elaine Benes. I'm at 145 West 81st St.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Elaine. Since this is non-urgent maintenance, we have some great mid-week slots available next week. Would Wednesday at 10:00 AM work for you?

**Human**: Yes, Wednesday works.

**AI Agent**: Excellent. I've scheduled your AC Spring Cleaning for Wednesday at 10:00 AM. By the way, would you be interested in hearing about our 'Maintenance Club'? Members get two tune-ups a year and a 15% discount on all repairs.

**Human**: Maybe next time.

**AI Agent**: No problem at all! You're all set for next Wednesday. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
