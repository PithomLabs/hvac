**Human**: I've been sneezing a lot since we started using the AC. Do you guys do duct cleaning?

**AI Agent**: We definitely do! Duct cleaning is a great way to improve indoor air quality and can significantly reduce allergens like dust and pollen in your home. Our standard service for a single-unit home is $299.

**Human**: $299 sounds reasonable if it stops the sneezing. Can we do that next month?

**AI Agent**: Absolutely. We can schedule that for next month to give you some time. What's your name and address?

**Human**: I'm Elaine Benes. 145 West 81st St. 

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Elaine. How does the first Monday of next month at 9:00 AM sound?

**Human**: That's fine.

**AI Agent**: Perfect. I've scheduled your Duct Cleaning for the first Monday of next month at 9:00 AM at 145 West 81st St. We'll get those vents sparkling clean! Is there anything else?
