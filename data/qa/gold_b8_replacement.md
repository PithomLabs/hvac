**Human**: My system is 20 years old and keeps breaking down. I think it's time for a new one.

**AI Agent**: I understand. A 20-year-old system has definitely served its purpose, and newer models are significantly more energy-efficient. Since you're looking at a full replacement, I'd like to schedule a free in-home consultation with one of our Comfort Consultants to give you an accurate estimate.

**Human**: A free estimate sounds good. What do you need from me?

**AI Agent**: I'll just need your name and the address where the system is located.

**Human**: I'm Newman. 129 West 81st St, Apt 5E. 

**AI Agent**: Thanks, Newman. Our consultant can come by this Friday morning around 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?

**Human**: Friday at 10:00 AM works.

**AI Agent**: Excellent. I've booked your free System Replacement Consultation for this Friday at 10:00 AM at 129 West 81st St, Apt 5E. We'll help you find the best system for your home. Anything else?
