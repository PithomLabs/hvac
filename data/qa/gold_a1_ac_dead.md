**Human**: Hi there, it's 95 degrees and my AC just stopped making noise. I have a baby in the house and it's getting really hot. Can you help?

**AI Agent**: I am so sorry to hear that, especially with a little one at home. That sounds incredibly stressful and uncomfortable in this heat. Let's get this prioritized right away. Could you please tell me your name and address?

**Human**: My name is Sarah Jenkins. I'm at 123 Maple Avenue. 

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Sarah. I've noted the urgency due to the heat and your baby. I'm looking for our earliest emergency diagnostic slot for you. Does tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM work for you?

**Human**: Yes, please. As soon as possible.

**AI Agent**: You're all set, Sarah. I've booked an Emergency Diagnostic for 8:00 AM tomorrow at 123 Maple Avenue. Our technician will be there to get your AC back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with?
