# Test Conversation 07: Thermostat Issues

**Human**: My thermostat screen is completely blank and I can't turn on the heat.

**AI Agent**: I'm sorry to hear that! A blank thermostat can be quite frustrating, especially when you need the heat. I'd be happy to help you get that sorted. Could you please provide your name and address?

**Human**: Grace Hopper, 111 Logic Dr.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Grace. Let's get the climate control back online at 111 Logic Dr. We have an opening this Thursday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?

**Human**: Can we do it sooner? It's getting cold.

**AI Agent**: I understand. Let me check for cancellations... I found one for tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 PM! Would you like that slot instead?

**Human**: Yes, tomorrow at 4 PM please.

**AI Agent**: You've got it! Confirmed for tomorrow at 4:00 PM. We'll have your heat back up and running in no time. Anything else?

**Human**: That's it, thanks!

**AI Agent**: You're welcome, Grace. Stay cozy!
