# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a1_ac_dead.md

**Human**: Hi there, it's 95 degrees and my AC just stopped making noise. I have a baby in the house and it's getting really hot. Can you help?

**AI Agent**: I'm so sorry to hear this — 95 degrees is brutal, and I completely understand the urgency with a baby in the house. Let's troubleshoot this step by step to see what's going on.

First, let's quickly check the basics (I know it sounds simple, but it solves a surprising number of issues):

1. **Thermostat**: Is it set to "cool" and the temperature well below your current room temp? Try setting it 5 degrees lower than the room temp.

2. **Circuit Breaker**: Check your electrical panel for any tripped breakers, especially for the AC unit and furnace/air handler.

3. **Air Filter**: When did you last change it? A super dirty filter can actually cause the system to shut down.

4. **Indoor Unit**: Check if there's water standing around your indoor unit (furnace or air handler). If the condensate drain is clogged, it will shut everything down as a safety measure.

5. **Outdoor Unit**: Is the fan running on the outside condenser unit? If the fan isn't spinning but the unit is humming, that could be a capacitor issue.

While we're figuring this out, here are some ways to keep the baby safe and cool:
- Move to the lowest level of your home (heat rises)
- Close blinds/curtains to block sun
- Use fans to circulate air (even without AC, moving air feels cooler)
- Keep baby in just a diaper or light clothing
- Cool bath or damp washcloths on wrists/neck

If you've checked those basics and it's still not working, or if you notice any burning smells, water leaks, or electrical issues, we should get a technician out ASAP — especially with an infant at home. We have emergency slots available for situations just like this.

Can you tell me what you're seeing when you look at the thermostat and units?

**Human**: "Thanks for the quick checklist—I’m already doing these things! Let me check on my end. My thermostat is set to 'cool' and I turned it down to 68, but the AC just stays off completely. No lights, nothing. I did check the indoor unit and there’s no water, which is good, but the outdoor unit’s fan isn’t moving at all. It’s just silent on both ends. Should I turn off the whole power to the unit or leave it running? Also, I haven’t changed the filter in months—would that cause a shutdown?"

**AI Agent**: Perfect troubleshooting! You've given me some really clear information. Based on what you're describing, here's what I think is happening:

**No lights, silence everywhere, and a dead outdoor unit** — that strongly suggests either:
1. A tripped circuit breaker (the most likely culprit)
2. A blown fuse in the outdoor disconnect box
3. A safety switch that's completely cut power

**The dirty filter** would typically cause the indoor unit to freeze up or the system to run poorly, but it wouldn't cause complete silence and darkness on both ends. However, it definitely needs to be changed once this is running again.

**Here's what I need you to do right now:**

**Check your main electrical panel first** — Look for any breakers labeled "AC," "Air Conditioner," "Condenser," or "HVAC." If you see any that are in the middle position (not fully on or off), flip them all the way OFF, then back ON firmly. Sometimes they trip but don't look obvious.

**Check the outdoor disconnect box** — This is usually a small grey box on the wall near your outdoor unit. Open it and see if there's a fuse or breaker inside that might be tripped/blown.

**Important**: Since your indoor unit also has no lights/display, this points to a power issue rather than just the outdoor unit. 

**Should you turn off the power?** — If you're going to be checking the electrical panel or disconnect box, yes, for safety, turn off the main breaker for the HVAC system while you inspect it. Turn it back on after checking.

**For the baby's immediate safety** — Since this is a "no power whatsoever" situation and it's 95°, this is definitely an emergency. If you can't get power restored quickly after checking the breaker, or if you're not comfortable checking electrical panels, we should get someone out to your home today. We prioritize calls with infants and elderly residents.

**Can you check those breakers and let me know what you find?** If they're all in the "on" position and the unit still won't power on, we'll get you scheduled for emergency service immediately.

**Human**: Okay, I’ll check the electrical panel right away. Let me see—I flipped all the breakers labeled "AC" and "HVAC" to make sure they were fully on, but nothing changed. They look fine to me. The outdoor disconnect box is inside a small metal panel outside the unit—I don’t see any fuses unless I open it. Should I do that? It feels a bit risky without an electrician. Oh, wait! Hold up—the main breaker for the whole house is set to 200A, but there’s a smaller switch labeled "zone 2" (where the AC is) that’s in the middle position. I flipped it all the way off and on, but still no power to the units. What does that mean? The baby’s getting really restless now…

**AI Agent**: I'm almost ready to book that for you. I just need your name and your address to finish up.

**Human**: "Sure, my name is Sarah Jenkins. I live at 127 Maple Lane, Apt 3B. What’s the best number to reach me once the technician arrives?"
