# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a4_frozen.md

**Human**: Help! My AC is barely blowing any air and I see actual ice on the copper pipe outside near the unit.

**AI Agent**: Turn off your AC immediately to prevent further damage—that ice indicates a refrigerant leak or airflow blockage. Leave the fan on to help thaw it safely, but don't run the cooling. We can send a tech today; what's your ZIP code and a good time for service?

**Human**: Take your time—just need the code first. How much do these fixes usually run?

**AI Agent**: I can get you scheduled and then provide a clear estimate once the tech diagnoses the exact issue—costs vary depending on whether it's a simple coil cleaning, refrigerant recharge, or something else. What's your ZIP code?

**Human**: 12345. How bad could the cost get?

**AI Agent**: Got it, 12345. I see a tech available tomorrow morning between 8-10 AM, or tomorrow afternoon—does either work for you?

As for cost, a basic fix like clearing a blockage might be under $200, while a refrigerant leak repair could run $500-$1,500 depending on severity. We’ll diagnose first and confirm before any work. Which time works best for you?

**Human**: Sarah Jenkins, what is your reply?
Tomorrow morning at 9 works for me.

**AI Agent**: Great, you're scheduled for tomorrow morning 8-10 AM in 12345. A confirmation text will be sent shortly. Keep the AC off until then. We'll see you in the morning.

**Human**: Thank you, that works. I'm all set.

**AI Agent**: Great, you're scheduled for tomorrow morning 8-10 AM in 12345. A confirmation text will be sent shortly. Keep the AC off until then. We'll see you in the morning.

**Human**: Thanks, I'm all set.

**AI Agent**: Great, you're scheduled for tomorrow morning 8-10 AM in 12345. A confirmation text will be sent shortly. Keep the AC off until then. We'll see you in the morning.
