# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a4_frozen.md

**Human**: Help! My AC is barely blowing any air and I see actual ice on the copper pipe outside near the unit.

**AI Agent**: I understand this is concerning. I need to get you scheduled for an emergency service right away.

To book this visit, I'll need a few quick details from you:
1. What is the name on the account?
2. What is the service address?
3. When would you be available for a technician to come out today?

**Human**: Sarah Jenkins.  
123 Maple Street, Apartment 5B.  
Any time after 2 PM today.

**AI Agent**: Thank you, Sarah. Let me check our availability for you today after 2 PM.

We have a technician available at 3:30 PM today to address the ice buildup and airflow issue. Does that time work for you?

**Human**: How much will the repair cost?

**AI Agent**: The initial visit is an $89 diagnostic fee, which includes the technician's inspection and a quote for the repair. We can't provide a final repair cost until the technician diagnoses the exact issue, but you'll know the price before any work begins.

Would you like me to book the 3:30 PM appointment?

**Human**: Yes, book the appointment. Has the technician fixed ice buildups before?

**AI Agent**: You're booked for 3:30 PM today, Sarah. Our technician is experienced with ice buildup issues and will get your AC blowing cold again. You'll receive a confirmation text shortly.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Does the $89 cover the full repair cost, or are there additional fees?

**AI Agent**: The $89 is just the diagnostic fee for the visit and assessment. If any repairs are needed, there will be additional costs for parts and labor. The technician will provide you with a complete quote for the full repair before starting any work, so you can decide how to proceed.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Okay, thanks. What’s the average repair cost for this kind of issue?

**AI Agent**: I can't provide an average repair cost since pricing varies greatly depending on the specific issue—whether it's a refrigerant leak, a bad capacitor, a blocked airflow, or something else. Your technician will be able to diagnose the exact problem at your 3:30 PM appointment and provide you with a precise quote for the repair.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Thanks for your help. I'm all set.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome, Sarah. Have a safe and great day
