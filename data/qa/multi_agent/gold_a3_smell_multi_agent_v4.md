# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a3_smell.md

**Human**: I just turned on the heat for the first time this season and it smells like burning plastic. What should I do?

**AI Agent**: Turn off the heat immediately for safety. That smell often means dust is burning off or something is overheating. Open windows for ventilation, and don't leave it running unattended.

If the smell is strong, persistent, or smells like electrical burning, stop using it and get it inspected. I can book a technician if you'd like—reply with your zip code.
