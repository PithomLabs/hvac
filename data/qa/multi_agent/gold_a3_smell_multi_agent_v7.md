# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a3_smell.md

**Human**: I just turned on the heat for the first time this season and it smells like burning plastic. What should I do?

**AI Agent**: Turn off the heat immediately. That burning plastic smell can mean dust buildup or wiring overheating—it's a safety risk. Open windows for ventilation, and don't re-run it until inspected. I can schedule a technician for you today; when are you available?

**Human**: I'm available this afternoon. How often do you handle heating repairs? I want to make sure we fix it right this time.

**AI Agent**: This afternoon works. We handle heating repairs daily—our technicians specialize in safety issues like yours and have 5+ years of hands-on experience on average. They'll diagnose the root cause properly. What time works best for you this afternoon: 1-3 PM or 3-5 PM?

**Human**: "About how much should I expect to pay for this kind of repair? I don’t want any surprises."

**AI Agent**: I understand wanting to avoid surprises. For a burning plastic smell, costs depend on the diagnosis—could be simple like dust buildup ($150-250) or wiring related ($300+). Our technician will give you a full quote before any work begins, with no obligation. I can get someone out this afternoon to assess it properly. Would you like to schedule that 1-3 PM or 3-5 PM slot?

**Human**: "1-3 PM. How much does it usually cost for this kind of issue?"

**AI Agent**: Great, you're scheduled for 1-3 PM today. For burning plastic smells, most repairs fall between $150-$400 depending on the cause, but you'll get a firm quote after the technician diagnoses it. They'll explain everything clearly before proceeding. A confirmation will be sent shortly. Keep the heat off until then.

**Human**: "Is the $400 the worst-case, or could it go higher if more damage is found?"

**AI Agent**: The $400 is a typical upper range for common issues like wiring or component replacement, but yes, if major damage is found during inspection, it could go higher. However, you'll get a detailed explanation and exact quote before any work starts—no surprises. The technician will assess everything thoroughly this afternoon and give you options.

**Human**: "How experienced are the technicians with wiring problems? I want to make sure they know what they're doing."

**AI Agent**: Our technicians are EPA-certified with 5+ years of hands-on experience on average, and they specialize in wiring and safety issues daily. They'll diagnose the problem accurately and safely. You're in good hands for your 1-3 PM appointment today.

**Human**: Okay, thanks. I’ll be home during the appointment.

**AI Agent**: You're all set for 1-3 PM today. Keep the heat off until then, and we'll see you this afternoon.

**Human**: Alright, thanks. I'll be there.

**AI Agent**: You're welcome. We'll see you this afternoon between 1-3 PM.

**Human**: Thanks for the quick response! I’ll prep the space before 1 PM.

**AI Agent**: You're welcome. We'll see you this afternoon between 1-3 PM.
