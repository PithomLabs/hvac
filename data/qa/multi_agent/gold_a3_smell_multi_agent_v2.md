# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a3_smell.md

**Human**: I just turned on the heat for the first time this season and it smells like burning plastic. What should I do?

**AI Agent**: Turn the heat off immediately for safety—it shouldn't smell like burning plastic. This is often dust burning off the first use, but it could indicate wiring issues. Open windows for ventilation and wait 10-15 minutes before restarting. If the smell persists or you see smoke, do not restart and evacuate if needed.

I can help you schedule a technician for an inspection. Please confirm your zip code, preferred date/time, and contact details to book an appointment.

**Human**: Is the technician experienced with HVAC issues like burning smells or wiring problems? I want to make sure it’s someone who knows what they’re doing.

**AI Agent**: Yes, all our technicians are EPA-certified and specifically trained to diagnose electrical faults and burning odors in heating systems. They carry diagnostic tools like multimeters and thermal cameras to pinpoint issues safely without guesswork.
