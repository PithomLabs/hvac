# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a1_ac_dead.md

**Human**: Hi there, it's 95 degrees and my AC just stopped making noise. I have a baby in the house and it's getting really hot. Can you help?

**AI Agent**: I'm very sorry to hear this—95 degrees is dangerous and stressful, especially with a baby in the house. Your safety comes first, so let’s act quickly:

**Immediate Steps:**
1. **Prioritize Safety:** Move your baby to the coolest area (e.g., basement or shaded room) and use fans, cool cloths, or a shallow bath to help keep them comfortable while we troubleshoot.
2. **Quick Checks (if safe):**
   - Ensure the thermostat is set to "cool" and the temperature is set below the current room temp.
   - Check if the circuit breaker for the AC has tripped (flip it off and on if unsure).
   - Replace or clean the air filter if it’s clogged—this is a common cause of sudden shutdowns.

**Next Steps:**
This sounds like a potential safety issue due to the heat and your baby’s vulnerability. I strongly recommend booking an emergency service visit for today. 

Would you like me to help you schedule an emergency technician right away? I can check availability and prioritize your case. 

Please stay safe and let me know how else I can assist.

**Human**: "Okay, I’d like to schedule an emergency technician right away. My baby and I need help fast!"

**AI Agent**: Of course, I understand the urgency—let’s get this sorted for you immediately. I’ll start by checking emergency technician availability in your area and prioritize your booking.

**To proceed, I need a couple of details:**
- Your **zip code** (to locate the nearest available technician).
- Your **best contact phone number** (so the tech can reach you upon arrival).

Once I have this, I’ll confirm your emergency appointment and provide an estimated arrival time. In the meantime, please keep your baby in the coolest part of the home and use fans or cool cloths to help manage the heat.

I’m here to help—let me know your zip code and phone number, and I’ll secure your emergency booking right now.

**Human**: I'm ready to share my details—my zip code is 75124 and my phone number is 555-867-5309. Please hurry, it's really hot inside!

**AI Agent**: Alright, I'm pulling up emergency availability for your location right now. I see you're in the 75124 area, and I'll be prioritizing your booking with your contact number (555-867-5309) on file.

While I'm securing your appointment, please continue to keep your baby cool and hydrated. You can use a damp cloth on their forehead, neck, and limbs, and keep them in just a diaper if comfortable.

I'll have a confirmed appointment and ETA for you in just a moment.
