# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_a1_ac_dead.md

**Human**: Hi there, it's 95 degrees and my AC just stopped making noise. I have a baby in the house and it's getting really hot. Can you help?

**AI Agent**: I am so sorry to hear that—it is incredibly stressful when your AC quits on a hot day, especially with a baby in the house. Your safety and comfort are the top priorities right now. Let’s walk through a few quick steps to see if we can get it running again, but if anything feels unsafe or the heat becomes uncomfortable for your baby, please do not hesitate to get to a cooler place or call emergency services.

**Immediate Safety Note:** If you or your baby start feeling overheated, dizzy, nauseous, or unusually tired, please move to a cooler location or a neighbor’s house right away. Heat exhaustion can come on quickly in little ones.

### Quick Troubleshooting Steps (2–3 minutes)

1. **Check the Thermostat**
   - Make sure it’s set to **Cool** and **Auto** (not “On,” which just runs the fan).
   - Set the temperature at least 5 degrees below the current room temp.
   - If it’s a programmable thermostat, try a temporary override.

2. **Check Power & Breakers**
   - Go to your main electrical panel and look for the **AC breaker** (usually labeled “AC,” “HVAC,” or “Condenser”).
   - If it’s tripped (middle position or red), flip it all the way off, then back on.
   - Also check the **furnace/air handler** breaker; some systems need both to run.
   - Look for a **power switch** near the indoor unit (like a light switch) and make sure it’s on.

3. **Outdoor Unit (Condenser)**
   - Is the outdoor unit running? If you hear nothing at all, that could be a power issue or a failed component.
   - Look for debris, dirt, or tall grass blocking airflow around the unit.
   - If you feel comfortable and it’s safe, gently clear any visible debris. **Do not remove panels or touch internal parts.**

4. **Indoor Air Handler**
   - Listen for the blower fan inside. If you hear a hum but no airflow, there could be a filter or airflow issue.
   - Check the **air filter**; a very dirty filter can restrict airflow and cause the system to shut down. Replace if it looks clogged.

5. **Listen for Clicks or Humming**
   - If you hear a click from the thermostat or outdoor unit but nothing starts, that can indicate an electrical or component issue.

### If It Still Won’t Start

- **Try the thermostat’s system reset** (power cycle the thermostat by removing it from the wall base for 30 seconds, then reattaching).
- If the outdoor unit makes a humming noise but won’t start, **turn the system off** at the thermostat to prevent compressor damage and call for service.

### Keeping Your Baby Cool While We Figure This Out

- Close blinds and curtains to block sunlight.
- Use fans to circulate air; even if it’s not cool, moving air can help.
- Keep your baby in the coolest room (often a lower level).
- Dress baby in light, breathable clothing and keep fluids coming.
- A cool, damp washcloth on the back of the neck or forehead can help; avoid ice-cold baths.

### Next Steps for Professional Help

If the basic checks don’t restore cooling—or if you’d prefer a pro handle it—I can help arrange a service visit. To schedule quickly, please reply with:

- Your **zip code** and any **access notes** (gate code, pets, parking).
- **Best time to reach you** and if you prefer morning or afternoon.
- Whether you rent or own (if you rent, do you know your landlord’s preferred process?).
- **Thermostat brand/model** if easy to find (or take a photo).
- Any **error codes** on the thermostat or blinking lights on the outdoor unit.

If you smell burning, see smoke, or notice water leaking inside, turn the system off at the breaker and call for urgent service (and let me know right away).

How would you like to proceed—want to try a couple more checks together, or shall I get a technician scheduled?

**Human**: "Sure, let's schedule a service. My zip code is 55202, and I'm available this afternoon. I rent, so I'll coordinate with my landlord. I don't have any error codes, just total silence from the AC."

**AI Agent**: I can absolutely get a technician scheduled for you this afternoon. To lock in an appointment, I need a few quick details:

- **Address** (unit number if applicable)
- **Best callback number**
- **Access notes**: gate code, pets, parking instructions
- **Preferred time window** (e.g., 12–2 pm, 1–3 pm, 2–4 pm)
- Landlord’s **contact name and phone number** for authorization and payment
- Any **gate or building access codes** the tech will need

While I’m pulling up availability for 55202, a couple of interim tips to keep the heat manageable:

- Keep blinds/curtains drawn and fans running.
- If you have a portable cooler or damp towels, place them near where you and the baby are sitting.
- Keep offering fluids to the baby and check diaper changes frequently; staying dry helps comfort.
- Let the landlord know **ASAP** so they can pre-authorize the repair.

Once you provide the details above, I’ll confirm the earliest appointment and send a confirmation. If the heat becomes unsafe before then, head to a cooler area or neighbor’s place and call your landlord immediately.
