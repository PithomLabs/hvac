# Multi-Agent Conversation Simulation (Single-Process)

**Scenario**: data/qa/gold_b5_tuneup.md

**Human**: I just want to schedule my spring cleaning for the AC.

**AI Agent**: I'd be happy to help you schedule a spring cleaning for your AC. To get you booked, I'll need a few details:

- Your name
- Service address
- Preferred date and time for the visit

What works best for you?

**Human**: My name is Sarah Jenkins. The address is 78 Pine Street, Riverside. I’d prefer Thursday at 2 PM. Can I see a technician with at least 5 years of experience?

**AI Agent**: I understand you'd like a technician with at least 5 years of experience for your spring cleaning. I have you down for Thursday at 2 PM at 78 Pine Street, Riverside.

Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee a specific technician or their years of experience in advance. We'll assign the most qualified available technician for your appointment.

Would you like me to proceed with booking Thursday at 2 PM for your AC spring cleaning?

**Human**: Proceed. How can you ensure the technician has 5 years of experience? What’s the expected cost?

**AI Agent**: I'll go ahead and book you for Thursday at 2 PM for your AC spring cleaning.

Regarding experience levels: while I cannot guarantee a specific technician or their years of experience in advance, I can make a note of your preference. Our team consists of qualified, certified technicians, and we'll assign someone appropriate for your service.

The cost for a spring cleaning/AC tune-up is typically $89-$129, depending on the unit size and any additional services needed. I'll have the technician provide you with a complete breakdown before any work begins.

Your appointment is confirmed for Thursday at 2 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Thanks. What should I expect if the AC needs repairs during the service? Will that affect the cost?

**AI Agent**: Good question. If the technician discovers repairs are needed during your spring cleaning:

1. They'll stop and explain exactly what's wrong
2. Provide you with a detailed quote for the repair work
3. Get your approval before proceeding with any additional work

The repair costs are completely separate from your spring cleaning service fee. You won't be charged for repairs unless you explicitly approve them first.

If repairs are needed, the technician can typically handle them the same day if we have the parts in stock, or schedule a follow-up visit if parts need to be ordered.

You're all set for Thursday at 2 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: "Will the technician be assigned based on their experience level, or will that depend on availability?"

**AI Agent**: The assignment is based on availability first and foremost. However, our dispatch team does consider the complexity of the service when assigning technicians. Since spring cleanings are routine maintenance, they'll assign whoever is available in your area at that time.

While I can't guarantee someone with exactly 5 years of experience, all our technicians are certified and trained to handle spring cleanings thoroughly. If you have specific concerns about your system, you can mention them to the technician when they arrive.

Your appointment is confirmed for Thursday at 2 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Thanks. I’ll wait for the confirmation text.

**AI Agent**: Perfect! You're all set for Thursday at 2 PM for your AC spring cleaning at 78 Pine Street, Riverside. The confirmation text should arrive shortly.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Human**: Thanks again. I'm all set.

**AI Agent**: You're very welcome. Have a great day!
