**Human**: Help! My AC is barely blowing any air and I see actual ice on the copper pipe outside near the unit. 

**AI Agent**: It sounds like your system's evaporator coil has frozen over. To prevent further damage and to allow a technician to inspect it, please turn your AC off immediately but keep the fan setting on 'Manual' or 'On' to help thaw it out.

**Human**: Okay, I've turned the AC off and the fan is on. Can someone come out today?

**AI Agent**: Actually, it takes several hours for the unit to completely thaw out. If a technician arrives while it's still frozen, they won't be able to diagnose the root cause. I'd recommend we schedule someone for tomorrow morning to ensure it's ready for a full inspection. Does 9:00 AM tomorrow work for you?

**Human**: That makes sense. Tomorrow at 9:00 AM is fine. My name is George Costanza.

**AI Agent**: Thanks, George. I'll need your address to finalize the booking for 9:00 AM tomorrow.

**Human**: I'm at 101 Vandelay Way. 

**AI Agent**: Got it. I've booked a repair for George Costanza at 101 Vandelay Way for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Remember to keep the AC off until the technician arrives. Is there anything else?
