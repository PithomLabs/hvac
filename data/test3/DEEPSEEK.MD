Here are the modified initial prompts for each scenario, retaining the core issue and urgency but with varied phrasing and tone.

---

**A: Emergency**
1.  **AC Dead:** "My air conditioner just quit completely on the hottest day of the year. Inside temperature is climbing fast and I have an infant. Need urgent help."
2.  **Leaking Furnace:** "I found a growing pool of water around my furnace in the basement. It seems to be actively leaking. Can you send someone to stop it?"
3.  **Burning Smell:** "A really sharp, acrid smell—like burning wires or plastic—started coming from the vents when I turned the heat on. I shut it off, but I'm concerned."
4.  **Frozen Coil:** "My AC airflow has dropped to nothing, and the outdoor unit has a block of ice on the pipes. Is this an emergency repair?"

**B: Maintenance**
5.  **Annual Tune-Up:** "Looking to schedule a preventative maintenance check for my central air conditioner before summer hits."
6.  **Filter Confusion:** "My system is alerting me to replace the filter, but I can't figure out the correct size or where to buy it. Can you assist?"
7.  **Smart Thermostat:** "I need a professional installation for a smart thermostat I purchased. Do you provide that service?"
8.  **System Replacement:** "Our aging HVAC system is becoming unreliable. We're interested in getting an estimate for a full replacement."

**C: Logistics**
9.  **Reschedule:** "I need to postpone my scheduled service appointment. What's the process for rescheduling?"
10. **Specific Window:** "Due to my work hours, I require a service visit within a very specific time frame: Tuesday, 2 PM to 4 PM. Is that possible?"
11. **Gate Code:** "For access, your technician will need to enter the gate code 1234 upon arrival."
12. **Tenant/Landlord:** "I'm the tenant, but my landlord is the point of contact and will handle payment. What information do you need from both of us?"

**D: Edge Cases**
13. **Price Haggle:** "Your diagnostic fee seems high compared to local competitors. Can you match a lower rate or explain what justifies the cost?"
14. **Vague Noise:** "My HVAC system is producing a strange, recurring thumping noise that's new and concerning. Should I be worried?"
15. **Wrong Area:** "I'm located outside your typical service area, in Springfield. Do you extend service that far, and what are the charges?"
16. **Callback/Angry:** "The repair you completed yesterday has already failed. My system is not working again, and I am very dissatisfied. I need this resolved immediately."

**E: Technical**
17. **Heat Pump:** "My heating isn't working. I'm not sure if I have a traditional furnace or a heat pump—does that change the service needed?"
18. **Duct Cleaning:** "We've noticed more dust and allergy symptoms since running the AC. Do you provide duct cleaning services, and is it effective?"
19. **Simplified/Language:** "No heat in house. Please send help. Address: 789 Elm St."
20. **Nonsense Input:** "Sorry, that was my child. My actual issue is the AC is not cooling—it's blowing room-temperature air."
